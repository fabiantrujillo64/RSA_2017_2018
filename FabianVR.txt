In this video, I demonstrate the functions of my RSA project that was coded using Python. At the beginning, I am presented with three options: encrypt, decrypt and exit. I start off by choosing to encrypt a message. Encrypt will provide a secret encrypted message using the recipient's public key. I am prompted to type the e value and once I type in the e value I can type in the n value. Once that’s done, I type in my message, and when I press enter it’s encrypted into a bunch of foreign characters. I would be able to retrieve the message now and I would be able to decrypt it using the recipient’s private key. Once again I am given three options and I choose to decrypt the message I created. Then, I am asked to input the d and n value which would allow me to finally decrypt the message. I input the encrypted message that I created and then press enter to decrypt it. Finally, the message is decrypted back to its normal state. Once I’ve performed all the operations that I wanted to accomplish, I can finally close the program by typing in exit. This will print “program complete” and this would break out of the while loop within the program.
